## ‚ú® Features

*   **Effortless Attendance Tracking:**
    *   üì∏ **Real-time Face Recognition:** Employees can check-in and check-out by simply looking at the camera.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:**
    *   üì± **Responsive Design:** Seamless experience across devices.
    *   üåì **Theme Toggle:** Customize the look and feel with light and dark modes.
*   **Local Data Storage:** Employee and attendance data are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/attend-vision.git
    cd attend-vision
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   You may need to configure Genkit/Google AI related environment variables if not already set up for your environment (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified by your environment).

## Employee Data

Employee data (including name, ID, and face image URI) is managed via `localStorage`. For the face recognition to work, employee data needs to be present. This might involve:
*   Manually adding data to `localStorage` via browser developer tools.
*   Using a script or a temporary UI (not included by default in this simplified version) to populate initial employee data.

The `CameraView` component expects employee data to be available through the `DataContext` for matching and recording attendance.
